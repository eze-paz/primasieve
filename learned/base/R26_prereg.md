# R26 preregistrations and results (second session; plan in R26_plan.md)
Reference: next-word mix 7.1524 on paragraphs 500-999 (R25-co); language model 6.7001 (R25-cs); question panels +288 untouched.

## T01 registration (Krause-style dynamic evaluation)
r25_dyneval.py --rms: after each read paragraph, theta <- theta - eta * g / (sqrt(ms) + 1e-8) + lam * (theta0 - theta), ms a running mean of squared gradients (0.9 / 0.1) over the text read so far; grid eta in {1e-4, 3e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3}, lam in {0, 0.001, 0.01}, chosen on 0-499. Alone against plain SGD (7.6238), then in the R25-co mix in place of D and with B re-derived in-group (r25_ingroup on the new probabilities). PASS if alone < 7.6238.
