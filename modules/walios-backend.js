// Single source of truth for the walios Python backend.
//
// Consumed by BOTH modules/sandpie-worker.js (run_python + the walios shell tool, via
// importScripts) and /walios/terminal.html (via a <script> tag), so the interactive
// terminal can never drift onto a different CPython than the one the agent runs. It had:
// python -> the old stdlib-only python.wasm, worker ?v=dlopen6, no certifi, no matplotlib.
//
// Plain classic script on purpose — sandpie-worker.js is a classic Worker and cannot
// `import`, so this assigns onto the global instead of exporting.

(function (g) {
  // Bumped with every wali-worker.js deploy.
  // dlopen9: the host no longer silently answers 0 for unimplemented `wali.*` imports.
  // __wasm_thread_spawn now returns EAGAIN so threading.Thread().start() raises
  // RuntimeError instead of trapping the whole interpreter (exit 139).
  // dlopen10: one armed itimer had TWO delivery sources (a polled deadline and a real
  // setTimeout) and neither cancelled the other, so a ONE-SHOT setitimer/alarm fired
  // SIGALRM twice -- measured 2 handler entries where 1 was expected. In Python the
  // second delivery re-entered the handler inside the except clause of the first and
  // went uncaught, which is exactly the _set_timeout pattern.
  // dlopen11: fork returns ENOSYS on a binary without Asyncify (CPython). It used to
  // hand back a pid and never run the child, so subprocess/os.popen waited out the
  // whole timeout; now they raise OSError immediately.
  // dlopen14: file modes persist. OPFS has no modes, so chmod lived in RAM and every
  // OPFS-backed file came back 0644 on the next boot (ssh refused its own key again).
  // opfs-worker.js now keeps a mode sidecar in IndexedDB (SETMODE op, returned with
  // READDIR); the kernel guesses 0600 under .ssh/ and 0755 for *.sh when there is no
  // record. Also: 'add-pkg' creates the /bin/<name> stub (a package added mid-session
  // was "not found" by name), and a seeded "#!" blob lands 0755.
  // dlopen15: the WASI shim re-syncs its memory views before every call. A guest that
  // grew linear memory (malloc -> memory.grow) detached the cached DataView, and the
  // next call touching it threw -> exit 139. QuickJS died on every real run (`-q`,
  // `-e`) because JS_NewRuntime grows once and then calls clock_time_get; `--version`
  // never grows. poll_oneoff also writes *nevents now instead of leaving it garbage.
  // dlopen16: every WASI process gets fd 3 = "/" preopened. Only the root module and
  // wasi-threads binaries had one, so a WASI child exec'd from the shell (qjs) could
  // not open any path: `qjs -e` worked, `qjs /tmp/t.js` and std.open() said ENOENT.
  // dlopen17: ONE engine. Every process runs on its own worker; the kernel is a
  // never-blocked async syscall server. The two older execution engines are gone, and
  // with them the stdin/mount SAB bridges that only
  // existed to feed a parked kernel, the sync lazy-fetch, and the separate wasi-threads
  // proxy (merged into the process worker: imported shared memory + thread mode). One
  // exec path (resolveExec + startProcess). WASI guests must link shared memory
  // (wasm32-wasi-threads); qjs/qjsc were rebuilt that way.
  // dlopen18: real pthreads. wali-musl's __wasm_thread_spawn starts a second instance of
  // the module on the same shared memory (threadSpawn), running its exported
  // __wasm_thread_start_libc; SYS_futex WAIT/WAKE block and wake for real in sysAsync;
  // gettid is per thread. python_cxx.wasm ?v=8 IMPORTS its memory (a thread cannot
  // share a memory the module defines) -- scripts/wasm-import-memory.mjs did that to the
  // deployed binary. threading.Thread, Lock, Event, Condition, Timer work in the REPL,
  // run_python and the walios() tool; a thread calling into a dlopen'd extension (numpy)
  // is still not supported (the side module is linked into the main instance's table).
  // dlopen19: the run message takes `links` (symlinks seeded before the guest runs);
  // runMessage adds /files -> /root so Pyodide-style paths work on this backend.
  // dlopen20: /dev/hostcall -- the guest->host RPC as a device, independent of stdio.
  // The frame-on-stdout / reply-on-stdin channel broke under any redirection: `python3
  // -c "import matplotlib" | head` sent the bundle request into the pipe and waited on a
  // stdin that was the shell's (a heredoc), and hung until the timeout. Requests written
  // to /dev/hostcall are answered on the same fd; `mount` is served by the kernel itself,
  // other ops reach the host as {t:'hostcall'} messages. sitecustomize, soffice and apk
  // use the device when present and fall back to stdio on an older kernel.
  // dlopen21: WASI fd_read/fd_write are the SAME code as the Linux read/write, per iov,
  // with errnos translated -- the second copy lacked the pty kind, so a WASI program's
  // output vanished in the terminal (pty stdio) while the walios() tool (plain stdio)
  // showed it. WASI fd_read also blocks now (waitReadable) instead of reading EOF.
  // dlopen22: an OPFS bridge that cannot start (no navigator.storage.getDirectory --
  // Playwright's WebKit on Windows) answers EIO instead of never answering, and the
  // kernel bounds its wait on the bridge to 20s and then declares the store dead. The
  // guest used to park forever on the first `ls /root`. Found by the browser test.
  // dlopen23: the OPFS bridge answers EBUSY (not EACCES) when another sync access handle
  // holds a file, and the kernel names that case. A run killed on timeout left its bridge
  // worker alive with its handles; the next run's fresh bridge could not open those files
  // and the kernel said "in Dropbox but could not be downloaded" -- a git repo that had
  // just been cloned "became not a git repository". Hosts must terminate the bridge when
  // they kill a kernel (sandpie-worker does now).
  // dlopen24: clang as a GUEST. The kernel's page-side compiler bridge (cc/ar/wfetch/
  // wextract forwarded to the terminal page) is gone; yowasp's LLVM runs as an ordinary
  // WASI process (clang.wasm, shared memory). Needed for that: real per-file inodes in
  // stat (LLVM's FileManager keyed its cache on (dev, ino) and every file was ino 1, so a
  // header was "the same file" as the source that included it), path_symlink and
  // fd_filestat_set_size/set_times in the WASI shim, and import signatures for wasm
  // binaries exec'd from the VFS (a freshly compiled ./hello could not start).
  // sig26: kernel diagnostics under a pty are CRLF-framed (a bare newline left the cursor
  // mid-line and ls staircased after a walios: warning); an OPFS directory the Dropbox index
  // knows but has no children of lists empty instead of ENOENT.
  // sig27: the OPFS bridge stamps "picked up" into the control block, so the kernel's 20s
  // dead-bridge guard no longer fires on a legitimately slow operation -- opening a
  // cloud-only file downloads it from Dropbox first, and one large file on a slow link
  // used to disable /root for the rest of the session. A slow op waits up to 10 min and
  // fails only itself.
  // sig28: /root is shareable. OPFS sync-access handles (exclusive per file, origin-wide)
  // are released 250ms after the last fd to the file closes instead of at the end of the
  // run/session; directory listings expire after 1.5s and reconcile (another kernel's new,
  // resized or deleted files show up); the bridge renames with FileSystemFileHandle.move()
  // (atomic, as git assumes) and stats a listing's entries in parallel. Several kernels --
  // terminal, tool, REPL, one per conversation -- work on the same repo at once.
  // sig29: the vfork child window belongs to the FORKING THREAD. git's sideband thread
  // exiting while the main thread spawned index-pack closed the window, and the execve
  // replaced the parent: "fatal: early EOF" on every deepening fetch of a shallow clone.
  // The WISP bridge answers EBADF/EOF for a stream the relay dropped instead of throwing
  // (which parked the kernel for good); git-upload-pack/receive-pack stubs for file://.
  const   // sig30: the child window's cwd/umask/signal table are the forking thread's view too (a
  // sibling thread saw the child's SIG_DFL table during the window); exit_group from any
  // thread ends the process; a thread may fork+exec.
// sig31: the 0-length pipe-write fix (POSIX says write(fd, buf, 0) transfers nothing;
  // the kernel pushed an empty chunk, the reader took it for EOF and exited, and the
  // writer's next real write got EPIPE), plus the walios-node hook that starts a JS
  // process worker for node-stub.wasm.
// mkdir32: mkdir in the workspace reported EPERM while SUCCEEDING -- opfsLoaded is a Map
// and the handler called .add(), which threw after the OPFS mkdir had already worked;
// the dispatcher turns any handler exception into -1. Broke `tar x` into /root,
// `mkdir ~/.ssh`, git clone into a new dir, and multi-call builds. mkdir(2) on an
// existing path is now EEXIST too, instead of silently succeeding (mkdir -p semantics).
// killall33: the tool's deadline stops the PROCESSES and keeps the kernel, so a run that
// runs out of budget no longer takes /tmp and every compiled module down with it.
// devexec36: posix_spawn landed in the kernel (ef751c3) without a bump, so any browser
// holding ?v=devexec35 kept running the kernel from BEFORE it -- node's child_process
// broken, and no way to tell from the page that it was serving a stale worker.
