"""Lazy package mounting for EVERY python in walios, not just the warm REPL.

The heavy packages (numpy, pandas, Pillow, python-docx, matplotlib, reportlab, …)
live in tarballs the host mounts on demand. Until now only ONE of the three walios
hosts could actually get at them:

  run_python (warm REPL)  walios-repl.py installs its own meta_path finder that calls
                          out to the host on an import miss                    -> works
  terminal.html           no host RPC channel, so it unpacks EVERY bundle up front
                          before the prompt appears                            -> works, slowly
  walios() shell tool     lazy bundle list (nothing heavy unpacked) AND no way to ask
                          for a mount                                          -> BROKE

Measured before this file existed, same script in both: `import numpy` PASSED in the
terminal and raised ModuleNotFoundError in the walios() tool; same for pandas, PIL and
docx. Four of seven capability checks diverged.

This puts the finder on the default path (site imports `sitecustomize` at startup), so
a plain `python3 -c "import numpy"` gets the same packages the REPL does, wherever it
runs. The framing is the same one soffice.py already uses: a base64 JSON frame on fd 1,
the reply as a base64 JSON line on fd 0.

It is INERT unless the host says it is listening (SANDPIE_HOST_RPC=1). The terminal
does not set it — there the bundles are already mounted, nothing would answer a frame,
and emitting one into a pty would just corrupt the user's screen.
